# Introduction to Using Git and GitHub with R {.inverse}

## What is Git? {.inverse}

::: {.notes}
Intro
- If you've used R for a while, you've probably wondered how to work with others
- This course will teach you how
- In the process, you'll learn to use Git and GitHub, which are great tools even if you are working solo on a project
- Git and GitHub have some incredibly confusing concepts so we'll use a metaphor throughout this course

Video
- Show git metaphor Keyes Architects video

Git + GitHub
- There are a lot of confusing terms and we'll simplify them
- Why you don't need to understand internals/all details of git to use it

Why you should learn to use Git and GitHub
  1. complete history/backup
  2. work on code with others efficiently
  3. best way to do project management for code projects
:::

## How the Course Works {.inverse}

::: {.notes}
Tools we'll use
- Covers RStudio and GH Desktop early on, but only GH Desktop later
- I'll put command line equivalents in Learn More sections, but won't present on them

Why I use these tools
- Lots of uppity people talking about terminal, but Jenny Bryan says: no merit badges for git
- For simple git stuff, RStudio is all you need
- If you want to do more complicated things, use GHD
- GHD lets you do the thing you want without worrying about esoteric terminal commands: https://show.rfor.us/l9F8ZZNp
- GHD is actually better per Daniel Sjoberg quote:  https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7238979946767900672?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7238979946767900672%2C7238998663769812992%29&replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7238979946767900672%2C7239042170224058368%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287238998663769812992%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7238979946767900672%29&dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287239042170224058368%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7238979946767900672%29

## Update Everything {.inverse}

::: {.notes}
Video: 
- architect has to get new pens and paper etc
- Or maybe Drafting Tools: Architect’s scale, T-square, compass, protractor, and drafting pencils. https://arc.net/l/quote/dhzdcagw

Update
- R
- RStudio
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn} 

1. Update R
1. Reinstall packages
1. Update RStudio

# Git {.inverse}

## Install Git {.inverse}

::: {.notes}
- Video: filing cabinet system set up

- Install GitHub Desktop
- Show how to install git by itself if necessary
- Show git in RStudio
- Check git version
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

1. Install GitHub Desktop
1. Install git separately (only if necessary)
1. Confirm git installed correctly by checking version using `git --version` in the terminal

## Configure Git {.inverse}

::: {.notes}
- Video: Get customized sticky notes printed with name and email on them

- In GHD
- In RStudio
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

1. Configure Git by adding a user name and email to your profile using GitHub Desktop

## Create a Local Git Repository {.inverse}

::: {.notes}
- Video: Get new filing cabinet to add to office

In RStudio and GHD
- When starting new project
- In RStudio, talk about it with usethis as well as when creating a new project
- When creating repo from existing project

Working directory
- Working directory (basically same as repo) (see https://medium.com/tech-journey-with-anna/git-question-what-is-the-difference-between-the-working-directory-aka-workspace-and-the-eeee15b7e4b3)
- "The working directory is like a work bench it is where you edit your files, add new files and delete files." - https://arc.net/l/quote/pzezrgof
- Working directory becomes a repository once we create local git repo

Ignoring files
- RStudio does this by default; GH Desktop does this if you choose template
- Why would you ignore files?
- Make sure you don't include things by accident
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

1. Create new Quarto website project in RStudio
1. Make sure to create git repo while doing creating new project

## Commits {.inverse}

::: {.notes}
Video: 
- architect works for a while and then decides to add work to filing cabinet. 
- Staging area: Talk about section of desk as staging area to decide which files to include. 
- Commit messages = sticky note attached to files that talk about what has changed. 
- Commit = add things in file folder and attach commit message. 
- Hash = unique identifier stamped on file folder as it goes through tubes.

Stage/staging area
- Choosing which files to include in repo

Committing
- Commit Message (like email subject line; no more than 50/72 characters): typically in present tense
- Commit description (like email body) but rarely used
- Make small commits

Show in GHD/RStudio
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

1. Make changes to website project
1. Make commit

## Commit History

::: {.notes}
Video
- open up filing cabinet and see history. 
- Git also gives you the ability to see changes between each commit (diffs).

- View history of changes
- Diffs in RStudio and GH Desktop
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

- View commit history in RStudio and GH Desktop

# GitHub

## GitHub Repositories

::: {.notes}
Video
- GitHub is like central office where all blueprints is hosted. 
- This is good as a backup for an individual, but also it enables collaboration.

David
- There are other systems (GitLab etc)
- One repo per project in R
- Commit history is same on GH as what we saw locally
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

Open the GitHub repository for my website project

Click on commits

Take a look through the commit history to see how the code changed over time

## Connect to GitHub

::: {.notes}
Video: 
- Build pneumatic tube that connects desk to central office. 
- Talk about local vs remote/origin

David: 
- Sign up for GH
- In GH Desktop, sign into GitHub
- In RStudio, do PAT business
- Tell people to do RStudio PAT business because it will enable them to install repos (check if removing credentials means you can no longer install packages). See https://arc.net/l/quote/aharrxyw

Local vs remote
- Local vs remote/origin (see https://arc.net/l/quote/muqmphgn)
- GitHub is your remote
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

Connect to GH with both GHD and RStudio

## Push Repository from Local to Remote

::: {.notes}
Video: 
- pneumatic tubes (branch off of main tube connecting office to HQ) connect local repo to remote repo
- Initial push happens with all materials going from office to HQ

Publish repo
- In GH Desktop, publish to GH
- In RStudio, use `usethis::use_github()`
- Talk about public vs private repos
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

- Push website project to GH

## Pull Repository from Remote to Local

::: {.notes}
Video
- pneumatic tubes built to connect HQ to office
- Initial pull (clone) happens with all materials going from HQ to office

David
- Create new repo on GH and clone it locally
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

- Clone repo to local

## Keep Local and Remote in Sync


::: {.notes}
Video
- show blueprints going back and forth

Pushing
- Work locally
- Commit along way
- Push to GH
- Reminder about small commits
- Talk about how this has all been working by myself, but next section is about collaboration with others

Pulling
- Show it in RStudio + GHD
- Fetch vs pull (Pull = fetch + merge) see https://arc.net/l/quote/vsndbbpg

From here on out, just using GH Desktop
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

- Make commit on local repo

- Push to GH

- Do this with RStudio and GHD

# Collaboration with GitHub

## Why Use GitHub vs Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, etc?

::: {.notes}
No animated video

Benefits: 

Backup / able to view history

Collaboration
- With other tools, multiple people can't work on code at same time
- Explain what this would look like for working on blueprint

Project management built into GH
- Issues
- Branches/PRs

Automation
- Publish stuff online
- Automatically scheduling code to run through GH Actions (like blueprints being printed automatically)
:::

## Project Management with GitHub

::: {.notes}
Video: show board where tasks are posted and architects get their tasks each day on arriving to work

Issues

- Reference changes with SHA
- Task lists
- Assigning people

Organize issues

- Labels for ongoing things
- Milestones for one-time things
- Projects to see all things visually

Notifications

- How to see all notifications on issues/PRs/etc: https://github.com/notifications

Branches and pull requests

- We'll come back to 
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

- Create issue

- Solve issue in your code

- Make commit

- Reference commit in issue

- Close issue

## Branches

::: {.notes}
Video: Show architects making copies of blueprints and putting them in different shelves of repo filing cabinet

Why should you use them

- Do PRs to get feedback
- Test things and only merge back in if you like what you did
- Test things on live site

Linking issues to branches
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

- Create issue and associated branch

- Solve issue in your code

- Make commit

## Pull Requests

::: {.notes}
Video: architect submits work on piece of house and someone else reviews it

David
- Show merging without PR first and explain why it isn't ideal 
- Show PR
- Dealing with merge conflicts in PRs (say that this will be discussed more in future lesson)
- Code reviews
- Magic words for closing

For your turn have people do PR on their own repo
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

- Open PR from branch

- Review code in PR

- Merge PR

# Common Git Problems and Solutions

## Can't Pull from GitHub

::: {.notes}
Video: Show architect with work done locally that would be overwritten by pulling

David
- Need to commit changes locally first
- Can use stashes: 
  - https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/stashing-changes-in-github-desktop
  - https://happygitwithr.com/pull-tricky
  - https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPractice/blob/main/03-FilesystemInteractions.adoc#temporarily-stash-some-changes-git-stash
  - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning
- Can also discard changes in GHD

Talk about why using stashes isn't that great: https://happygitwithr.com/pull-tricky#other-approaches

This is why branches are helpful
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

Make edit to website locally but don't commit changes

Make edit to website on GitHub.com and saave it

Pull from GH and get message about needing to commit changes before pulling

Pull again, making sure you can successfully bring in the changes from GitHub

Heads up: you should get a message about a merge conflict. We’ll deal with this in the next lesson!

## Merge Conflicts

::: {.notes}
Video: show conflict where two people edit same part of blueprint file

Sometimes you have conflicts with what someone else did

How to deal:

- Deal with them in text editor locally
- Use GHD to deal with them
- Deal with them on GitHub.com
- Show them when working in main branch and with PRs

In PRs, update branch from main periodically in order to not get too far behind and avoid merge conflicts when submitting PR

From Deepansh Khurana PPT:

> Resolve Conflicts Locally: When you resolve conflicts on DevOps, GitHub or GitLab, you commit before you test. When you resolve conflicts locally, you commit after you test. This helps you avoid unexpected and unintentional breakage in the code.
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

You should have a merge conflict from last lesson

Fix merge conflict using RStudio, GHD, or GitHub.com

Make a commit if necessary

Push code to GitHub

## Can't Push Code to GitHub

::: {.notes}
Video: Show architect who doesn't have latest code pulled and why he can't push

Have to pull first
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

Make an edit on on GitHub

Make an edit locally

Attempt to push your changes from RStudio to GitHub (it should fail)

Pull in changes from GitHub

Deal with any merge conflicts

Push your changes from RStudio to GitHub

## Use gitignore to Avoid Conflicts

::: {.notes}
Video: 
- Architect has cheatsheet of unit conversions, but never wants this to be committed so adds it to gitignore
- Or has something proprietary and wants to ensure it won't be posted by accident
- Or has files that are created from source code that will likely cause merge conflicts so doesn't want them tracked

David
- Ignore things you never want added (better than unchecking them every commit)
- Ignore sensitive data (see lesson below)
- Ignore files that may be commonly overwritten
:::

## Your Turn {.your-turn}

Add _site to gitignore

## Best Practices for Using Git and GitHub

::: {.notes}
No animated video

Always pull before pushing

Make small commits

- Nick Hodges quote
- Maelle Salmon blog post

Push early and often

Use branches

:::

## How to Avoid Putting Sensitive Information on GitHub

::: {.notes}
- Video: special proprietary paint color used in blueprints that you don't want on GitHub so you add it to gitignore

Options:
- gitignore files
- Use special location on network drive etc in code that only internal people can access
- Put data in some other tool and access it with a package like googlesheets4
- Use environment variables
:::

## Continuous Deployment


::: {.notes}
Video: Architect makes builder version of blueprints locally and then pushes them to Netlify
:::

## Use GitHub Actions to Run Code Automatically

::: {.notes}
Video: Blueprints for builder get built each time there is a commit (or on a schedule)
